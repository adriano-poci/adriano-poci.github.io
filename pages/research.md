## Current Research

Currently I am working on developing a self-consistent comprehensive galaxy formation model that combines triaxial orbit-superposition Schwarzschild dynamical models with full-spectral-fitting stellar-population analyses. The combination provides unprecidented archeological constraints on the formation and evoluion of nearby galaxies. Not only does this method bridge the once-independent field of stellar populations and stellar kinematics, but there is a heavy emphasis on maintaining self-consistency (for instance, see earlier research below).   
A first application of this methodology was published in [Poci et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.3776P/abstract). I am now working on extending and applying this model to data from the [Fornax3D survey](http://www.na.astro.it/Fornax3D/Fornax3D/Welcome.html)

## Past Research

Earlier work was focused on investigating the impact of including the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> into dynamical models, in order to relax the assumption of a spatially-constant <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> of most previous implementations. This work used the Jeans Anisotropic Model ([JAM](http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/); [Cappellari, 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C/abstract)).   
The results of that work were two-fold;

    <div class="grid-row" style="grid-column: 3; grid-row: 1; text-align: left;">Testing the impact of including a spatially-varying <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> on the inferred dynamical mismatch parameter, &alpha;<sub>dyn.</sub>. This parameter measures the offset between the dynamically-inferred and stellar-population-inferred galaxy mass, in effect constraining the accuracy of the assumed stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF). The case with the spatially-varying <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> from my work is shown on the left, while the original result, for a spatially-constant <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH>, is shown on the right (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Natur.484..485C/abstract">Cappellari et al. (2012)</a>. This results shows that the dynamical models with a spatially-varying <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> show a systematic offset to lower &alpha;<sub>dyn.</sub> values, but important, the non-linear trend with mass remains.</div>
