## <u>Current Research

Current I am working on developing a self-consistent comprehensive galaxy formation model that combines triaxial orbit-superposition Schwarzschild dynamical models with full-spectral-fitting stellar-population analyses. The combination provides unprecidented archeological constraints on the formation and evoluion of nearby galaxies.   
A first application of this methodology was published in [Poci et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.487.3776P/abstract). I am now working on extending and applying this model to data from the [Fornax3D survey](http://www.na.astro.it/Fornax3D/Fornax3D/Welcome.html)

## Past Research

My earlier work was investigating the impact of including the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio <MATH>(M<sub>&#9733;</sub>/L)</MATH> into dynamical models. That work used the Jeans Anisotropic Model ([JAM](http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~mxc/software/); [Cappellari, 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.390...71C/abstract)).   
The results of that work were two-fold;
